          Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us
          Live and push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and
          professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
          and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the
          shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to
          contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music
          culture.

          Rather than having a one-sizing-fits-all process, we try to give our
          people what they need to work their magic and grow. We´ve learned that
          achieving the best results comes from building temas that are richly
          diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of
          perspectives. We don´t always agree with each other, but opinion and
          debate are valued and openly encouraged.
